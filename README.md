## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting patient outcomes** (e.g., disease progression or recovery likelihood) using healthcare data such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatment details.  
The goal is to enable healthcare providers to **personalize treatment plans** and improve patient care through **data-driven insights**.

By applying **machine learning** and the **CRISP-DM framework**, this project builds, evaluates, and refines multiple predictive models — showcasing expertise in **data preprocessing, model evaluation, and healthcare analytics**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop ML models to predict patient outcomes using clinical and demographic data.  
- Compare multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest).  
- Evaluate performance using key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC).  
- Refine models via hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis.  
- Build visual tools to interpret model results for healthcare decision-makers.

## 🧠 Methodology

This project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** approach:

1. **Business Understanding** – Define the healthcare problem and expected impact.  
2. **Data Understanding** – Perform EDA to identify data quality issues, outliers, and patterns.  
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean and preprocess data, apply one-hot encoding, handle missing values.  
4. **Modeling** – Train and compare Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Random Forest models.  
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.  
6. **Deployment (Prototype)** – Prepare models for integration into a clinical decision support tool.
